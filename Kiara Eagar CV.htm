                <p>Au Pair</p>
                    <p>I am currently an au pairing for two girls, aged 4 and 5, that require a little extra attention and stimulation in the afternoons after school.</p>
                        <h5>Responsibilities</h5>
                            <ul>

                                <li>Take them to their respective extra-mural activities</li>
                                <li>Assist in homework, projects or activities for school</li>
                                <li>General care and supervision</li>

                                <li>Do Occupational Therapy exercises with the girls to improve their fine and gross motor skills and stimulate their mental and physical abilities</li>
                            </ul>

                <p>Au Pair/Special Needs Companion</p>
                <p>I worked with and was a companion for a 17-year-old girl with Cerebral Palsy.</p>
                    <h5>Responsibilities</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Help to instil lessons she was taught in the morning by her mom and do additional activities to help her understanding of things around her</li>
                            <li>Sensory stimulation in both play and specific activities for both enjoyment and development</li>
                            <li>Muscle message and exercise, to relax her muscles. She has higher muscle tone than normal and the inability to relax and control her own muscles. The muscle message helps her in being more comfortable and enables those around her to assist her more easily</li>
                            <li>Hygiene and toilet assistance</li>
                            <li>Play and crafts</li>

            <h4>February 2014 – November 2014</h4>
                <p>Caregiver and Administration • Pathways Roodepoort</p>
                <p>At Pathways Roodepoort, a stimulation centre for disabled children, I was a caregiver to 2 classes. One class was with children who have autism and one with children that have cerebral palsy between the ages of 6 and 8. Schools that specialize in special needs children require many caregivers, and the ratio is for every three children there must be one caregiver. In each class I was responsible for two children at a time.</p>
                <p>From time to time I would also work in the office doing administrative work.</p>
                    <h5>Responsibilities</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Help the children get to their class from their school buses. Many of the children are in wheelchairs or need assistance when walking</li>
                            <li>Do morning circle with children, which was based on providing routine, as well as learning basic daily things like weather and days of the week</li>
                            <li>Do activities (Each day has a different activity, e.g. Tuesday is art day)  </li>
                            <li>Feed children lunch. Most of the children have poor body control or special awareness and either need to be fed or assisted when feeding themselves</li>
                            <li>Work on fine (including using a spoon, picking things up etc) and gross motor skills (include standing, walking, etc). All of which help make both the children and their parents daily life more manageable</li>
                            <li>Get children ready to board the school bus to go home</li>
                            <li>On occasion, I worked in the office reorganizing, refiling and assisting on activity and worksheet preparation</li>
                        </ul>

                <p>Au Pair</p>
                <p>I cared for a young boy on the autism spectrum. His name is Nicholas who I still see often. I grew a lot through being a companion to Nic, and he was my biggest inspiration for the direction in I took in my studies and decision for what I could see myself doing as a career. He remains within my life and I always cherish the bond we have.</p>

                            <li>Transportation. I would fetch him from school, take him to extra activities such as swimming, and then take him back home</li>
                            <li>Assist with his therapy</li>
                            <li>Go on fun outings with him, such as movies or taking him to playgrounds, which were some of his favourite things to do</li>
